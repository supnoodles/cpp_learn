// STL in c++

// 1. STL = Standard Template Library
// 2. It consists of three components:
//    a. Container
//    b. Iterator
//    c. Algorithm

/*
Sequence Containers - data structures which can be accessed sequentially.
Associative Containers - sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log(n)))
*/
